- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilanPrackoCodeSetter shortly Milan. A few years ago I had finished my master's degree in experimental physics at Charles University in Prague, and after that, I fall in love with programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in strong type language C#, TypeScript. I like the syntactic, architectural, programming side of code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about asynchronous and parallel strategies in the code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project which is able to change the future.
- 📫 How to reach me, send me an email at milanpracko@gmail.com
